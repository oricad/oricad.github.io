Oricad was first developed by Simon Marynissen.
The idea came about after he participated in the [IOIO 2018](https://ioio.su/task/open_shuriken_stars) as a designer.
After a long journey of different programming languages and frameworks, he landed at C++ that has a few extensive libraries that help to eleviate the burden of programming this solely.
The first library is [CGAL], which is an open-source library of computational geometry algorithms.
The second library is [Qt], which is used to create cross-platform graphical user interfaces.

From the beginning, the choice was to make oricad open and free.
Therefore, the source code of Orica is licensed with [GPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
The choice of this particular copy-left software license was an effect of the licenses of CGAL and Qt.
